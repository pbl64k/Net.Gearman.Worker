Contrary to the name, this doesn't have much to do with Gearman workers.
I picked Gearman worker API more or less because I was looking into the
CPAN modules for those at the moment, but what I actually was after were
Accessors. Unfortunately, using them turned out to be a lot more fugly
than I hoped it would be.
